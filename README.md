# Comparative Genomics of *Orientia tsutsugamushi*

*Orientia tsutsugamushi* (Ot) is an obligate intracellular bacteria, a species under the order Rickettsiales within the family Rickettsiaceae. It infects both mites and mammals and is the causative agent of scrub typhus in humans. <br>

Ot has the most fragmented and repetitive genome of all bacteria. Its 2.0Mb - 2.7Mb genome is made up of about 70% degraded/complete version of a integrative and conjugative element called rickettsial amplified genetic element (RAGE). <br>

This project investigates the genome dynamics of Ot using 25 genomes (17 complete and 8 incomplete).<br>
